# DataLitSteamAnalysis

This repo contains the code, figures and documents created for Data Literacy course project at the University of TÃ¼bingen.

## Data

How to get the initial data is explained in the "src/000_InitialDataReading.ipynb".

## Generating the Figures

All figures were generated procedurally in the notebooks. Regenerating the figures is as easy as clicking "Run All"

## Environment

The `environment.yml` file has the required libraries and their versions.

## Notebooks

- Notebooks in the `src` folder are the main notebooks.
- `exp` have failed experiments, some things I have thought about but did not do, etc.
